# 🧑‍💻 Task 1: Using ChatGPT as Your Learning Assistant

## Scenario

You're new to DevOps and will frequently encounter technical questions. ChatGPT can be your learning companion.

## Your Task

Write a clear ChatGPT prompt to help you understand:

> "What is a protocol in networking? Explain with a simple real-life example."

Take a screenshot of your interaction showing:

* Your detailed prompt (with clear expectations)
* ChatGPT's simplified response with an example

## Screenshot

Save your screenshot in the `screenshots` folder and update the file name below.

## What I Learned (2–3 lines)

Add your answer here...
A network protocol is a standardized set of rules that allows devices to communicate and exchange data.
For example, when I open a website, DNS resolves the domain name to an IP address,
TCP establishes a reliable connection, and HTTPS enables secure communication between my browser and the web server.

# 🌐 Task 2: Internet and Networking

## Scenario

Your friend is launching an online bookstore named **EpicReads**.

He asked you to explain how users globally can access his website hosted in Finland.

## Your Task

Write a short explanation (**100–150 words**) that includes:

* Packet Switching
* IP Address
* TCP/IP
* HTTP/HTTPS

💡 **Tip:** You may use ChatGPT (as demonstrated in Task 1) to refine your explanation.

## Answer

Add your answer here...

--EpicReads is an online bookstore hosted on a server in Finland. Users worldwide can access the website through the internet using various networking technologies.

When a user types **www.epicreads.com** into a web browser, the Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain name into the server's **IP Address**, which identifies the server's location on the network.

The **TCP/IP** protocol suite enables communication between the user's device and the server, ensuring that data is correctly addressed, transmitted, and reliably delivered.

Through **Packet Switching**, information is divided into smaller packets that travel across different networks before being reassembled at their destination.

Finally, **HTTP/HTTPS** enables communication between the browser and the website. HTTPS encrypts the connection, protecting sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details.

Together, these technologies allow customers worldwide to browse and purchase books securely from EpicReads.-

# 🏗️ Task 3: Application Architecture & Stack

## Scenario

EpicReads bookstore has two application versions:

### Two-Tier Application

* Frontend
* Database

### Three-Tier Application

* Frontend
* Backend
* Database

## Your Task

* Draw simple diagrams (hand-drawn or tool-based such as draw.io)
* Label each layer clearly
* List at least two common technologies or tools used for each layer
* Submit a screenshot or photo clearly showing your own drawing

## Diagram Screenshot / Photo

Save your diagram image in the `screenshots` folder and update the file name below.

# 🌍 Task 4: Domain Name & DNS (Basic Concepts)

## Scenario

Your friend's bookstore **EpicReads** is currently accessible through:

```text
52.172.142.222:3000
```

He purchased the domain:

```text
epicreads.com
```

## Your Task

In **50–100 words**, explain in your own words:

1. What is DNS (Domain Name System)?
2. Which DNS record type should be used to connect the domain to the given IP, and why?

## Answer

Add your answer here...
1.DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet's phonebook. It translates a human-friendly domain name, such as epicreads.com, into an IP address that computers use to find a server. 
2.To connect epicreads.com to 52.172.142.222, you should use an A record because it maps a domain name directly to an IPv4 address. This allows users to enter the domain name instead of the numerical IP address.
 Since EpicReads runs on port 3000, users must enter epicreads.com:3000

# 💻 Task 5: Visual Studio Code Setup (Hands-on)

## Your Task

Install Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).

Take a screenshot of your VS Code environment showing:

* Terminal open inside VS Code
* Running a basic command:

### Windows

```powershell
dir
```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
pwd
ls
```

* Your selected VS Code theme clearly visible

⚠️ **Important:** The screenshot must show your username or another identifiable detail to confirm it is your environment.

## Screenshot

Save your screenshot in the `screenshots` folder and update the file name below.

![VS Code Setup Screenshot](screenshots/task-5-vscode.png)


Replace `task-5-vscode.png` with your actual screenshot file name.

# 🔗 Task 6: Publish Your Assignment as a LinkedIn Post

## Objective

Publishing on LinkedIn helps you:

* Build your professional online presence
* Reinforce your learning
* Document your DevOps journey publicly

## Your Task

Summarize your answers from Tasks 1–5 into a LinkedIn post.

Clearly structure your post into the following sections:

* ChatGPT
* Internet & Networking
* App Architecture
* DNS
* VS Code Setup
